Running

`./download-list-local.py` will create a text file with a list of records.

`./download-records-local.py` will download all records from `idlist.txt` and write them to `raw.xml`.

`./download-records-s3.py` will download a list of records, download each record, and upload them as gzipped XML file to AWS S3.

`./parse.py <file>` will parse the XML and produce normalized JSON, one JSON object per line.

`./es.py <file>` will take a file of JSON objects, and put them into a clean ElasticSearch index. It will delete the index if it already exists.
